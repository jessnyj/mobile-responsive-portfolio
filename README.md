## Work Involved
For this portfolio site, I created three html pages titled index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html. Using Bootstrap, I ensured that each page had a navbar, a responsive layout, and responsive images. Within each individual page I added different content such as an About Me section, images for the portfolio, and a contact me section. Furthermore, utilizing Bootstrap's responsive features, I was able to modify how the screen looks on different screens, including mobile devices.
